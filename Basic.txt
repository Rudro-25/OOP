Object − Objects have states and behaviors. Example: A dog has states - color, name, breed as well as behaviors – wagging the tail, barking, eating. An object is an instance of a class.

Class − A class can be defined as a template/blueprint that describes the behavior/state that the object of its type support. Like class name: dog -> color,barking, hungry, sleeping.

Variable:
1. Local- used inside methods,constructor, block
2. Instance- 
3. Class- declare within class/ outside method/ with static keyword..

Constructor:
1. same name as class
Public class MyClass {
   Int num;
   MyClass() {
      num = 100;
   }
}
MyClass t1 = new MyClass(); //acess as t1.num
method:
Just like function
code:
int c = minFunction(5, 11);
public static int minFunction(int n1, int n2) {
   int min;
   if (n1 > n2)
      min = n2;
   else
      min = n1;

   return min; 
}

#Object Oriented:

#Inheritence:
Child access parents properties. extends.
