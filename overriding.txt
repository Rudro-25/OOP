##Overriding:
  #If a class inherits a method from its superclass, then there is a chance to override the method provided that it is not marked final.
  
  #Benefit: ability to define a behavior that's specific to the subclass type, which means a subclass can implement a parent class method based on its requirement.
  
  #Example: 
  
      class Animal {
         public void move() {
            System.out.println("Animals can move");
         }
      }

      class Dog extends Animal {
         public void move() {
            System.out.println("Dogs can walk and run");
         }
      }

      public class TestDog {

         public static void main(String args[]) {
            Animal a = new Animal();   // Animal reference and object
            Animal b = new Dog();   // Animal reference but Dog object

            a.move();   // runs the method in Animal class
            b.move();   // runs the method in Dog class
         }
      }
